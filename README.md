# I'm William Duraney

## I help computers help people

I'm interested in crafting software that works, with a team of people that work, in order to help people with whatever they're trying to do.

Some technologies that I've been using lately:

- NodeJS (Typescript)
- React
- Pulumi (Infrastructure as Code)
- Kubernetes
- Temporal.io

Also I'm just really good at reading error messages thoroughly :)
